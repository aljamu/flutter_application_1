INTRODUCTION TO FLUTTER:

- Flutter is a UI-Framework
- uses Dart as programming language (OOP)
- an flutter app is composed of so called WIDGETS
- Layouts are created programmatically
- With State Management states are shared between widgets (MVVM)

===========================================================================================================

INTRODUCTION TO WIDGETS:

- building blocks of Flutter UI: "Everything is a Widget"
- each Widget is an immutable (= unable to be changed) declaration of part of the user interface
-> are used to describe all aspects of a user interface, including physical aspects such as TEXT and BUTTONS to lay out effects like padding and alignment
- form a hierarchy. Widgets get nested inside eachother. Root Widget -> (Parent Widget -> (Child W. -> Child of Child W.))
-> typically composed of many other small, single-purpose widgets that combine to produce powerful effects
    e.g.: The UTILITY WIDGET => Container has nested LAYOUT WIDGETS:
    (Don't have visual representation, they only control some aspect of another widgets layout)
    => Padding, 
    => Alignment, 
    => Row, 
    => Column, 
    => Grid


Building widgets:
- all widgets must have a build method and must return a widget
- To create a user interface in Flutter, you override the build method on widget objects.
- The framework calls the build method when this widget is created and when the dependencies of this widget change (e.g. state changed)


Widget State:
- The framework introduces two major classes of widget: stateful and stateless widgets
- STATELESS WIDGET: Widgets that have properties that dont change over time are subclasses of StatelessWidget (=> no mutable state). E.g. Padding, Text, ...
- STATEFUL WIDGET: if unique characteristics of a widget need to change based on USER INTERACTION or other factors. E.g. Counter increases on button click.
--> When that value changes, the widget needs to be rebuilt to update its part of the UI. and (because the widget itself is immutable) they 
        store mutable state in a separate class that subclasses State. Their User Interface is built through their State object
